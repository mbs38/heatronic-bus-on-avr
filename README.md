# heatronic-bus-on-avr
A tiny library implementing the transport layer of the ht3-bus that Bosch uses in many heating systems (Junkers among others). At the moment it can only read data from the bus. I wrote this because I wanted to build a very small reliable device that needed some data from the heating system. If you want a sophisticated solution for talking to your heating system there are other much more advanced projects out there :-)

Simple interface circuit:
